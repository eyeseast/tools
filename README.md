# Tools

This is a collection of one-off tools that can live on static hosting, built with LLMs, heavily inspired by [Simon Willison's tools collection](https://github.com/simonw/tools).

Each tool exists in a single directory with an `index.html` file. Most are a single HTML file, though some may include external data files. Everything can be hosted on static file storage.
